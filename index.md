# Welcome to the Nemudryi lab

Nemudryi lab has opened doors in September of 2024 in the [Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://biochem.med.ufl.edu) at the [UF College of Medicine](https://med.ufl.edu).





## Highlights


{% capture text %}

We use CRISPR-guided ribonucleases to study how human cells repair RNA and how RNA viruses co-opt these mechanisms for their own benefit.
<br><br>
Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern RNA repair and translate this understanding into new RNA editing tools for applications in science and medicine.
