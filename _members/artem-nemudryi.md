My hometown [Akademgorodok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akademgorodok) (Russian for *“Academic Town”*) in Siberia was designed to be the Silicon Valley of Russia, filled with research institutes solving problems ranging from Philosophy to Nuclear Physics. My parents and grandfather were researchers at institutes of Akademgorodok, and from a young age I expressed an interest becoming a third-generation scientist. I earned a Specialists degree in Biology from Novosibirsk State University in 2013 and my Ph. D. in Genetics from the Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibirsk, Russia) under the mentorship of Professor Suren Zakian. As a graduate student, I became interested in biology of prokaryotic CRISPR systems and their applications for editing eukaryotic genomes.

The course of my postdoctoral research with Professor Blake Wiedenheft was far from what I had envisioned when I came to the United States in 2018. When the COVID-19 pandemic broke, my studies wandered off into SARS-CoV-2 research, which included temporal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, developing viral diagnostics, and sequencing viral RNA genomes in nasal swabs from the local hospital. What at first appeared to be a temporary interruption changed the focus of my research and inspired my independent research program at University of Florida aimed at using programmable ribonucleases for fundamental studies of RNA repair and translating this mechanistic understanding into RNA editing tools for therapeutic applications.
