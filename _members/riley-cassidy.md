  [College of Medicine University Scholar](https://universityscholars.med.ufl.edu/)<br>

I am from South Florida and currently on a Pre-Med track, majoring in Microbiology with a minor in Health Sciences. I am particularly interested in the study of viral and cellular development. The complexities of various organismsâ€™ developmental patterns have fueled my passion for scientific research, pushing me to learn more. On campus, I am involved in organizations like Friends for Life and Community Health Service Corps. Off campus, I volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House. In my free time I enjoy reading, sewing, and the sunshine.
