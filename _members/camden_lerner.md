Iâ€™m originally from St. Petersburg, FL, and am majoring in Microbiology and Cell Science. I have biochemistry experience and am interested in understanding complex molecular workings. My plan is to get a PhD in structural biology, and ultimately lead a structural virology research program. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking healthy meals and running.
