I am from Sarasota, Florida, and I am double majoring in Biochemistry and Criminology on the Pre-Med track. I am most interested in studying various cellular immune systems and their unique molecular processes, especially their application to medicine. Outside of research, I volunteer with the Shands Arts in Medicine program. I also enjoy spending time with friends, art and drawing, and trying new places to eat!
