I'm originally from San Diego, California and moved to Boca Raton, Florida in 2016. I am majoring in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida. My goal is to obtain a PhD and focus on research relating to the application of genetic engineering in the field of medicine. Genome editing, vaccines, and CRISPR interest me greatly and are the topics that first got my foot in the door of pursuing research. Outside of research, I love to go rock climbing outdoors, line dance with friends, and jam out with music buddies!
