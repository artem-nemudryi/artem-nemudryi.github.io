I am actually a student at Santa Fe college finishing up my bachelor's degree in Industrial Biotechnology with an internship as an exit to the program. I am working at the Nemudryi lab to gain practical experience on how a real lab operates before getting a job in the biotech industry (since a class environment can only teach you so much). I love working with recombinant DNA, particularly in regards to transformation and transfection to drive production of a desired protein, like the Baculovirus Expression Vector system (BEVs) or recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs).
